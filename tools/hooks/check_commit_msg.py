"""commit-msg hook: forbid AI ``Co-Authored-By`` trailers (SportsDataverse-wide policy).

The human author is the sole attributable contributor on SDV commits/PRs, so any
``Co-Authored-By:`` trailer naming an AI tool is rejected. Reads the commit message file
(``argv[1]``); a non-zero exit blocks the commit.

Conventional-commit formatting is intentionally NOT enforced here — the automated
scraper commits (``CFB Raw Update (Start: ... End: ...)``) are not conventional and
must continue to pass. (sdv-py's variant additionally enforces Conventional Commits.)
