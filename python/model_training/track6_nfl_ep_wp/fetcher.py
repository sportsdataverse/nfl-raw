"""Raw NFL API JSON file library builder.

Fetches per-week game detail payloads from ``api.nfl.com`` and stores them as
JSON files on disk, one file per week per season/type combination.

Storage layout::

    {output_dir}/{season}/{season_type}/wk{week:02d}.json

Each file contains the raw list (or dict) returned by the
``/football/v2/experience/weekly-game-details`` endpoint, exactly as received
from the NFL Shield API.  Downstream tools can read these files via
:func:`load_weekly_raw` without re-hitting the network.

Usage::
