"""GSIS statType decode + per-play stats summation.

Faithful Python port of nflfastR's ``sum_play_stats`` (R/helper_tidy_play_stats.R).
Each play in the Shield ``driveChart`` carries a ``stats`` array; every entry has a
``statType`` (GSIS stat id), a ``yards`` value, a ``gsisPlayerId`` (already in the
nflverse ``00-00xxxxx`` id space), a ``gsisPlayerName``, and a ``teamId`` (UUID).
:func:`sum_play_stats` collapses that array into the flat outcome columns
nflfastR/nflverse expose (complete_pass, air_yards, passer/receiver ids, etc.).

Source-token semantics (per stat-effect tuple):
    ONE          -> literal 1 (binary indicator)
    YARDS        -> the entry's ``yards``
    ZERO         -> literal 0
    PID / PNAME  -> the entry's player id / name
    TEAM         -> the entry's teamId (resolved to an abbr downstream)
    *_IFNA       -> written only if the target column is still None (first writer wins)
    *_FILL       -> first-available slot in the matching FILL_GROUPS set, with
                    same-player de-dup (a player already in an earlier slot is skipped)

def sum_play_stats(stats: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Collapse a Shield play's ``stats`` array into nflverse-shape outcome columns.

    Faithful port of nflfastR ``sum_play_stats``. Iterates the per-play stat
    entries in order and applies each statType's effects. Unknown / no-op
    statTypes (and those absent from :data:`STAT_ID_EFFECTS`) are ignored,
    matching the R ``else NULL`` fall-through.

    Args:
        stats: The play's ``stats`` list. Each entry should carry ``statType``
            (int), ``yards`` (number), ``gsisPlayerId`` (str), ``gsisPlayerName``
            (str), and ``teamId`` (str). Missing keys default to ``None``/0.

    Returns:
        A flat dict of the outcome columns set by the play's stats. Binary
        indicators are ``1``; numeric columns hold their yard value; player /
        team columns hold ids / names / teamIds (TEAM resolved to abbr later).
        Columns not touched by any stat are simply absent (treat as 0 / None).

    Example:
        Sum a single completed-pass stat block::

            from python.native_pbp.stat_ids import sum_play_stats
            row = sum_play_stats([
