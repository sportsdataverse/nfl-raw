"""Core play parser: Shield ``driveChart`` -> base nflverse-shape play frame.

Builds the play-level spine — one row per play with identifiers, possession,
down/distance/field-position, clock, play_type and per-play stat outcomes
(via :func:`native_pbp.stat_ids.sum_play_stats`). Downstream modules
(players/description/features/labels) enrich this frame; the parity harness
diffs it against ``sportsdataverse.nfl.load_nfl_pbp``.

Possession is resolved by assigning each play to the drive whose
``[startedPlaySequenceNumber, endedPlaySequenceNumber]`` range contains the
play's ``playSequenceNumber`` (the feed's ``driveSequence`` is unreliable).
Plays falling between drives (kickoffs / PATs / timeouts) get a null posteam.
