"""End-to-end native PBP build: Shield game payload -> nflverse-shape play frame.

Chains the module pipeline (parse -> description -> features -> labels) into a
single frame carrying the Track 6 ``REQUIRED_COLUMNS`` (and more), reconstructed
entirely from the committed ``nfl/raw`` Shield feed (plus a game-level roof /
spread_line that come from a schedules join).
